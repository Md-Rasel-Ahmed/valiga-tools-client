- I used that tailwind and daisyUi to design this project.
- This is a full stack project with both server side and client side, here the server side is used as a Mongodb database.
- I used React Router to move from one page to another
- I use firebase hooks to make authentication easier
- If any user wants to buy product here, he must login
- If you want to buy end-to-end products, then you must buy according to the minimum quantity and you cannot buy out-of-available products.
- I used the React Hook form to make form validation easier
- If a user wants, he can give product review
- I used jwt web token to secure api
